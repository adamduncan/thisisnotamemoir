      <h2 class="text-uppercase">Synopsis</h2>
      <div>
        <p><em>This is not a Memoir</em> follows the story of Chris Ramsey, a young Australian man living in London.
          When
          he is
          suddenly diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer, he is forced onto a challenging new path.</p>
        <p>From first appointments to breaking the news to loved ones, Chris&rsquo; own voice guides the narrative. His
          story is brought to life in a surreal animated world. Objects from his memory float by, strange lights glow in
          hospital
          corridors and medical apparatus murmurs along the periphery.</p>
        <p>His journey is a winding road of treatments, surgeries, chemotherapy and the life Chris strives to live in
          spite of his diagnosis. An honest and unflinching reflection on balancing the moments of enthusiasm and hope
          with the bitter lows of medical setbacks and diminishing options.</p>
        <p><em>This is not a Memoir</em> is both a personal cancer journey and a familiar one that resonates with anyone
          affected by the disease.</p>
